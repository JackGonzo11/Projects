# Personal Projects
This repository has all of my personal projects that I have worked on outside of school and labs to achieve a better understanding of Python, C++, and data structures.

## About Me
My love for computers and software development started during my freshman year of high school in Winter Springs, Florida. During this time, I went out and bought the necessary parts to build my own computer. After a few hours of plugging various components in, I pressed the power button and saw the motherboard BIOS pop up on the screen. It was thrilling and I loved the entire process; it was like a giant Lego set without any instructions. This love for building computers quickly turned into a love for software development.
University of Florida’s programs and classes encompassing software development provided an environment for my passion to grow. I am currently enrolled in several programming courses, and have joined a research lab that focuses on machine intelligence in order to continue my dedication to software development outside of the traditional classroom environment. So far, I have learned about new languages, compilers, algorithms, and computer vision that I had merely glossed over previously. Learning about artificial intelligence and TensorFlow rekindled my love for programming in a way that I didn’t think was possible. The endless opportunities to learn new aspects of the field I love excites me the most about continuing this path into the future.
The problem solving aspect of software development is the most rewarding part of the process to. Finally achieving a program that works after hours of trial and error is invigorating. I have learned so much, and I am so excited about diving deeper into the field that is computer engineering.
Specialties: Java, Python, C++, ROS
